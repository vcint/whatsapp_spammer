## 🚀 What is This?

**WhatsApp Spammer** is a lightweight Python automation script designed to send repeated messages on platforms such as:

* WhatsApp Web
* Telegram Web
* Facebook Messenger
* Twitter DMs
* Instagram Chats

It uses Python libraries like `pyautogui` and `webbrowser` to simulate user behavior and automate messaging.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

This tool simulates keyboard input using `pyautogui` to repeatedly paste and send a copied message in the chosen chat window.

> 📝 No API integration or hacking involved — it automates actions a real user would manually perform.

* [`pyautogui`](https://pypi.org/project/pyautogui/)
